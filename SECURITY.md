## Reporting a Vulnerability

The WhatsApp Flow Server team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**ðŸ“§ guilherme@setupautomatizado.com.br**

Include the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**.
- **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate and determine the severity and impact.
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about our progress every **5-7 days**.
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be patched within **7 days**, high severity within **30 days**.
- **Public Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the public disclosure timeline.
- **Credit**: You will be credited in the security advisory (if desired).

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying WhatsApp Flow Server, follow these security practices:

#### 1. Environment Variables

- âœ… **Never commit** `.env` files to version control
- âœ… **Use strong passwords** for database credentials
- âœ… **Rotate secrets** regularly (every 3-6 months)
- âœ… **Use environment-specific** configurations

```bash
# Generate secure tokens
openssl rand -hex 32  # For API_TOKEN
openssl rand -base64 32  # For other secrets
```

#### 2. Encryption Keys

- âœ… **Generate strong RSA-2048 keys**
- âœ… **Store private keys securely** (never in code)
- âœ… **Use encrypted key storage** when possible
- âœ… **Backup keys securely** (encrypted backups)
- âœ… **Rotate keys annually**

```bash
# Generate keys with passphrase
npm run generate-keys
# Enter strong passphrase when prompted
```

#### 3. Network Security

- âœ… **Always use HTTPS** in production (required by WhatsApp)
- âœ… **Configure firewall** to restrict database access
- âœ… **Use VPN/private network** for database connections
- âœ… **Enable rate limiting** on endpoints
- âœ… **Implement IP whitelisting** for webhook endpoints

#### 4. Docker Security

- âœ… **Run as non-root user** (already configured)
- âœ… **Scan images** for vulnerabilities regularly
- âœ… **Keep base images updated**
- âœ… **Use official images only**
- âœ… **Limit container resources**

```bash
# Scan Docker image for vulnerabilities
docker scan setupautomatizado/whatsapp-flows-server:latest
```

#### 5. Database Security

- âœ… **Use strong database passwords**
- âœ… **Restrict database access** (firewall rules)
- âœ… **Enable SSL/TLS** for database connections
- âœ… **Regular backups** (encrypted)
- âœ… **Keep PostgreSQL updated**

#### 6. Application Security

- âœ… **Keep dependencies updated** (Dependabot enabled)
- âœ… **Monitor npm audit** warnings
- âœ… **Validate all inputs** (Zod schemas in place)
- âœ… **Sanitize user data**
- âœ… **Implement request size limits**

```bash
# Audit dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

#### 7. API Security

- âœ… **Use API tokens** for authentication
- âœ… **Validate webhook signatures** (X-Hub-Signature-256)
- âœ… **Implement CORS** properly
- âœ… **Rate limit endpoints**
- âœ… **Log security events**

#### 8. Monitoring & Logging

- âœ… **Enable structured logging** (Winston configured)
- âœ… **Monitor error rates**
- âœ… **Alert on suspicious activity**
- âœ… **Review logs regularly**
- âœ… **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, keys)

### Security Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Strong passwords for all services
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Encryption keys generated and secured
- [ ] Public key registered with Meta
- [ ] Webhook signature validation enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] CORS origins properly set
- [ ] Logs monitored
- [ ] Backups configured and tested
- [ ] Docker image scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Security headers enabled (Helmet configured)

## Known Security Considerations

### WhatsApp Flow Encryption

This implementation correctly handles the **mandatory IV flip pattern** required by WhatsApp:

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Outgoing responses must use FLIPPED IV
const flippedIV = Buffer.from(iv).reverse();
```

**Failure to flip IV will result in error 421 from WhatsApp.**

### Webhook Signature Validation

All webhook requests are validated using `X-Hub-Signature-256`:

```typescript
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', META_APP_SECRET)
  .update(JSON.stringify(body))
  .digest('hex');
```

**Never disable signature validation in production.**

### Response JSON Parsing

Webhook `response_json` is a **string** and must be parsed:

```typescript
// CORRECT
const data = JSON.parse(webhook.nfm_reply.response_json);

// WRONG - causes security issues
const data = webhook.nfm_reply.response_json;
```
